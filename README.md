## PORTABOWL — Recipe Management System

A simple command-line recipe management system written in C++. PORTABOWL lets you store, organize, search, and manage your favorite recipes all from the terminal.

## Features

- **Add Recipes** — Store a recipe's name, category, ingredients, and cooking instructions
- **View All Recipes** — Browse your entire recipe collection at a glance
- **Search by Name** — Quickly find a specific recipe by its name
- **Edit Recipes** — Update any field of an existing recipe, or edit everything at once
- **Delete Recipes** — Remove recipes you no longer need
- **Save & Load** — Recipes are saved to a `recipes.txt` file and automatically loaded on startup

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g. `g++` via GCC or MinGW)

g++ portabowl.cpp -o portabowl
```

./portabowl
```

On Windows:
```bash

```

## Usage

When you launch the program, you'll be greeted with the main menu:

```
==============================
PORTABOWL: RECIPE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

1. Add New Recipe
2. View All Recipes
3. Search Recipe by Name
4. Edit Recipe
5. Delete Recipe
6. Save Recipes
